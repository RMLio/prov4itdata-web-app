<p>Data portability is one of the pillars to enable users to control their data on the Web.
Initiatives such as the <a href="https://datatransferproject.dev/">Data Transfer Project</a> (DTP) take a step in this direction,
by providing an open-source, service-to-service data portability platform
so that individuals could move their data whenever they want.
However, such efforts — being hard-coded — miss transparency and interoperability.
On the one hand, when data is transferred between services,
there is no trust in whether this transfer was of high quality.
Assessment would require reviewing the source code, as data provenance is unavailable.
On the other hand, complying to this hard-coded platform requires development effort to create custom data models.
Existing interoperability standards are neglected.</p>
<p>In PROV4ITDaTa, we create a solution that is fully transparent and has fine-grained configuration to improve interoperability with other data models. Furthermore, the intermediate dataset generated from the source data and its provenance are <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/">FAIR</a> resources.
To achieve this, we will exploit and advance the existing open-source tools <a href="https://rml.io">RML.io</a> and <a href="https://comunica.dev/">Comunica</a>
and show its extensibility by directly applying it to the <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>RML.io is a declarative and generic toolset
to transparently generate FAIR Linked Data from (semi-)structured heterogeneous data
with automatic data provenance and fine-grained configuration to extract and transform (parts of) the source data.</li>
<li>Using Comunica, we can query multiple intermediate datasets to transfer to a new
service, generating a provenance trail of where the resulting data came from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining RML.io and Comunica for a fully transparent transfer process,
we improve current data portability approaches.
Also, assessing the provenance trail can add trust to a transfer process.
Being a fine-grained and declarative system, it sets up detailed configuration and provenance generation.
The transfer of personal data can be assessed before the data is accessed,
and legal audits can be performed automatically based on the structured and semantically sound provenance trail.
To show its applicability and extensibility for decentralized environments,
we will connect it to the Solid ecosystem,
giving users full control over their data.</p>

</div></code></pre>
<h3 id="components">Components</h3>
<p>The architecture comprises four main components</p>
<ul>
<li>PROVIT4DaTa Web App: a user interface to allow users transparently transport their data</li>
<li>Data Providers: an extensible set of existing (social) Data Providers from which the user can transfer its data</li>
<li>RML.io toolset: a set of open-source tools to generate standardized knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources</li>
<li>Solid pods: a personal data storage, putting the user in control of their own data</li>
</ul>
<p>The main component is the PROV4ITDaTa Web App, which performs the different steps required for transferring data from services (e.g. Flickr, Imgur, etc.) to a Solid pod.</p>
<ol>
<li>During the first step, the Web App obtains the credentials for authorized access to the services and the Solid pod.</li>
<li>In the second step, the RML.io toolset provides the necessary components for
<ol>
<li>consuming (protected) resources from Web APIs, and</li>
<li>transforming the fetched data to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In the third step, the <a href="#web-app">Web App</a> finalizes the data transfer by storing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a>, generated by the <a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RMLMapper-JAVA</a>, to the Solid pod.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="rml-mapping-documents"><a href="http://rml.io/spec.html">RML Mapping documents</a></h4>
<p>An RML Mapping provides the means to create semantically enriched RDF data from heterogenous and (semi-) structured sources, using a declarative set of rules (<a href="http://rml.io/spec.html">RML</a>).</p>
<p>Describing the Web API as a source in an RML Mapping allows the <a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RMLMapper</a> to determine how requests should be made in order to consume the Web API. Furthermore, it requires a one-time effort and avoids hard-coded implementations for each service to be added. The mapping can easily be reused for — and extended to — similar Web APIs.</p>
<h4 id="rmlmapper"><a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RMLMapper</a></h4>
<p>The RMLMapper, proxied by the <a href="#web-app">RMLMapper Web API</a>, processes the selected RML Mapping and yields both the generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> and <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a> data.</p>
<p>In the background, the RML Mapper determines how to consume a Web API based on its description, without the need for integrating code that is tightly coupled to a specific Web API. Such hard-coded implementations are error-prone and time-consuming (consider, for example, the creation of tests and rebuilding the application every time a service is added).</p>
<h4 id="solid-pods">Solid pods</h4>
<p>Solid pods can be used to create a <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/personal-information-management-system_en">Personal Information Management System</a> (PIMS),
giving individuals more control over their personal data.
Individuals can manage their personal data in secure online decentralized storage systems called pods:
secure personal web servers for data.
All data in a pod is accessible via the Solid Protocol.</p>
<p>When data is stored in someone's pod, they control who and what can access it.
and share them when and with whom they choose using Solid pods.
Providers of online services and advertisers need to interact with the Solid pod if they plan to process the individual's data.
This enables a human centric approach to personal information and new business models.</p>
<p>Any kind of data can be stored in a Solid pod, however, the ability to store Linked Data is what makes Solid special.
Linked Data gives Solid a common way to describe things and how they relate to each other,
in a way that other people and machines can understand.
This means that the data stored by Solid is portable and completely interoperable.</p>
<p>Anyone or anything that accesses data in a Solid pod uses a unique ID,
authenticated by a decentralized extension of <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>.
Solid's access control system uses these IDs to determine whether a person or application has access to a resource in a pod.</p>
<h4 id="web-app">Web App</h4>
<p>The Web App is the main entrypoint, allowing the user to select and execute an <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a> describing which Data Provider to consume data from, and how that data will be transformed to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a>.</p>
<p>Upon selecting an RML Mapping, the user can view and download its contents through the corresponding &quot;RML Rules&quot;-card (see <a href="#Demonstrator">Demonstrator</a>).
Using this RML Mapping, the user can inspect <em>how</em> its data will be processed <strong>prior to execution</strong>, and <strong>without requiring to inspect the source code</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, the raw RDF RML description is shown to the user,
however, since it is a structured semantic format,
automatic visualizations and explanatory descriptions can be created.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Web App guides the user through the necessary authorization steps, prior to execution.
Given the vulnerable information being exchanged, communication with the Web App occurs over <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>After successful execution, the generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> and <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a> become available for inspection and download.
The provenance information, structured using the W3C recommended standard <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O</a>,
allows further automatic processing to validate that all data is processed correctly acccording to the users expectations.</p>
<p>By providing the user not only with the generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> but also with the <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">data provenance</a>,
we address the transparency requirement other solutions lack.</p>
<p>The resulting <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> is stored onto the user's <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> pod, which can be verified through the &quot;Solid&quot;-card (see <a href="#Demonstrator">Demonstrator</a>).</p>
<p>As a result, this web app allows to unambiguously define the user's data using an RML Mapping and transparently transfer it between services.
The automatically generated provenance allows for inspection and validation of the processing.</p>
<h3 id="relation-to-dtp">Relation to DTP</h3>
<p>After reviewing the DTP repository, we concluded that although utilitary functions could be reused in a later stage,
we currently focus on an end-to-end system using solely RML.io and Comunica.
On the one hand, because these technologies allow more advanced data transfer processes than DTP (such as joining data from <em>different services</em> on the fly),
on the other hand, because integration efforts would put a too high burden on the current development sprints.</p>
<p>Once we have successfully created and validated our end-to-end demonstrator,
we will re-evaluate DTP and how we can properly integrate our technologies.</p>
<p>Below, a sketch is found into how we can integrate our technologies:
the DTP Input-Service utilitary functions are reused to authenticate and fetch data, the RML processing component and Comunica engine are wrapped in a DTP Data model interface as a new generic DTP component.</p>
<p><img src="img/dtp-architecture.png" alt="DTP Architecture Draft"></p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>We set out following requirements,
and linked them to the specific sections of the features we currently support,</p>
<ul>
<li>Configurable data portability and Personalization (available using personalized RML Mapping documents to configure the data transfer, see <a href="#mapping-files-to-transfer-data">this section</a>)</li>
<li>White-box data portability (via automatic data provenance generation, see <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">this section</a>)</li>
<li>Data Transparency when transferring your data (available as RML Mapping documents are also RDF, see <a href="#mapping-files-to-transfer-data">this section</a>)</li>
<li>FAIR Data Transfer (by using RDF as intermediate data model, see <a href="#output-rdf">this section</a>)</li>
<li>Data Interoperability (by using RDF as intermediate data model and configuration data model, see <a href="#output-rdf">this section</a> and <a href="#mapping-files-to-transfer-data">this section</a>)</li>
<li>Security (using standard secure connections such as HTTPS, see <a href="#security">this section</a>)</li>
<li>Quality (using default configuration files crafted by experts, and bound to quality checks, see <a href="#quality">this section</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, our system is comparable to DTP, as it supports (and is extensible to) multiple data sources, and allows data import into SOLID pods (see <a href="#data-portability">this section</a>).</p>
<h2 id="demonstrator">Demonstrator</h2>
<p>The upper part of the landing page provides the means for quickly initiating the transfer from a service to a <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> pod. Once the user selects the desired <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>, the transfer can be initiated by clicking the <code>[Execute]</code>-button. Initially, the user will be prompted to authorize with the <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> pod and the service defined as source in the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>.</p>
<p>The lower part allows the user to review</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>,</li>
<li>the generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a>, and</li>
<li>the <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a>, hence, upholding the transparency of our solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the user can inspect and verify that the generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> was successfully stored on to the <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> pod.</p>
<p><img src="img/walkthroughv02.gif" alt="Walkthrough"></p>
<p>The walkthrough above illustrates the flow of transferring data from a Data Provider (in this case, Flickr) to a Solid pod.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, the user selects an <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a> which comes available for inspection and download within the &quot;RML Rules&quot;-card.</li>
<li>Once the user hsa decided on which <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a> to use, the transfer process is triggered by pressing <code>[Execute]</code>.</li>
<li>When transferring for the first time, the user will have to login to the Solid pod.</li>
<li>Once the user has authenticated with Solid, the user will have to authenticate with the Data Provider (in this case, Flickr).</li>
<li>At this point, the actual transfer takes place. Upon success, the user will be notified and the generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a>, accompanied by its <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a>, will be available for inspection and download in the &quot;Generated RDF&quot;-card and &quot;Provenance&quot;-card, respectively.</li>
<li>Finally, the user can inspect the data being stored on the Solid pod through the &quot;Solid&quot;-card.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>Our toolchain is extensible to a wide variety of service.
We opted to initially support <a href="#Flickr">Flickr</a> and <a href="#Imgur">Imgur</a>.
Both services share a common purpose: uploading and sharing image-content.
However, despite this commonality, they differ in various aspects such as the underlying data model and how the resources should be accessed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our current use cases already showcase the flexibility of our approach,
however, more use cases will be supported in following sprints.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="flickr"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/about">Flickr</a></h3>
<p>Flickr is an online photo management and sharing application.
Its resources are made available through the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/">Flickr API</a>. Flickr follows the <a href="https://oauth.net/core/1.0a/">OAuth1.0a</a> protocol which requires that requests to protected resources are signed using the Consumer Secret and Token Secret. By specifying the protocol in the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a> the <a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RMLMapper-JAVA</a> takes care of the necessary steps for creating requests to protected resources. This also contributes to the extensibility of our solution: when a service decides to change to another protocol, only changes to the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a> must be made. Hence, avoiding the need for rebuilding code.</p>
<p>The data fields mapped from a Flickr Collection resource are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: a unique identifier for that Collection resource</li>
<li><code>title</code>: the title of the Collection resource</li>
<li><code>description</code>: the description of the Collection resource</li>
</ul>
<p>The data fields mapped from a Flickr Photoset resource are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: a unique identifier for that Photoset resource</li>
<li><code>owner</code>: owner of the Photoset resource</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="imgur"><a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a></h3>
<p>Imgur, an image hosting and sharing website, enables its users to quickly upload and share images and GIFs on social media platforms (e.g. Reddit, Twitter, etc.).
Unlike the Flickr API, the <a href="https://apidocs.imgur.com/">Imgur API</a> uses OAuth 2.0.
When making requests for protected resources it suffices to add a bearer token to the HTTP headers.</p>
<p>The data fields mapped from the Imgur image resources are</p>
<ul>
<li><code>id</code>: a unique identifier for that image</li>
<li><code>link</code>: the URL to the image</li>
<li><code>description</code>: the description of the image</li>
<li><code>views</code>: the number of views</li>
<li><code>height</code>: height of the image</li>
<li><code>width</code>: width of the image</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We plan to include a more technical section detailing how different Data Providers can be handled uniformly using the RML.io toolchain</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Within this project, we envisioned following features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing users to choose from <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s crafted by experts. This allows for personalization of the data processing pipeline whilst reassuring qualitative transformation. See <a href="#mapping-files-to-transfer-data">Mapping files to transfer data</a>.</li>
<li>Allowing the users to inspect how data was transformed by the selected <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>. See <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a>.</li>
<li>Transparent transfer of user data to <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> pods. See <a href="#output-rdf">Output RDF</a>.</li>
<li>Extensible to any number of services, without requiring rebuilding the software. See <a href="#data-portability">Data portability</a>.</li>
<li>Making use of Open Standards and Open Source software. See <a href="#use-open-standards-and-open-source">Use Open Standards and Open Source</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-open-standards-and-open-source">Use Open Standards and Open Source</h3>
<p>By supporting existing standards where possible,
we aim to minimize the required foundational work.
Widespread adoption and understanding of existing standards makes this possible.</p>
<p>PROV4ITDaTa is an Open Source initiative to transparently transfer data from Data Providers to your own personal data vault.</p>
<p>It makes use of Open Standards such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> protocol to authenticate with Data Providers where possible,</li>
<li>an <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> extension to authenticate with the Solid pods,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">REST architectural style</a> to publish our PROV4ITDaTa Web app,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">Resource Description Format</a> (RDF) to model our personal data in a structured and semantic knowledge graph,</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/">R2RML</a> extension <a href="http://rml.io/spec.html">RML</a> to declaratively describe how to generate RDF knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources, and</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a> specification to interact with the Solid pods.</li>
</ul>
<p>It contributes to following Open Source projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RMLMapper-java</a> (MIT licensed): the RML processor the generate the RDF knowledge graphs;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-webapi-js">RMLMapper web API</a> (MIT licensed): a wrapper to publish the RMLMapper-java as a RESTful web service; and</li>
<li>PROV4ITData Web app (MIT licensed): the web application to interlink the different components.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In later iterations, it is assumed we will include <a href="https://comunica.dev/">Comunica</a>, a knowledge graph querying framework, to further expand the functionalities of PROV4ITDaTa.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mapping-files-to-transfer-data">Mapping files to transfer data</h3>
<p>In PROV4ITDaTa, the original Data Provider data is transformed into well-defined <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> knowledge graphs.
As such, the resulting data have a clear context and meaning by using established semantic ontologies,
and the original data is made interoperable.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on a hard-coded system to generate the RDF knowledge graph,
we make use of the <a href="http://rml.io/spec.html">RDF Mapping Language</a>:
a language to declaratively describe how to generate RDF knowledge graphs from heterogeneous data sources.
These mapping files are created manually by experts,
to ensure that established ontologies are used, and high-quality knowledge graphs are generated.</p>
<p>As the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s can include data transformations,
we can ensure data is cleansed during the data transfer process.</p>
<p>The resulting data transfer process adheres to the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/">FAIR</a> principles, as the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s are</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Findable</em> on the Web App as RDF resources following the <a href="http://rml.io/spec.html">RML specification</a>, based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/">R2RML W3C standard</a>,</li>
<li><em>Accessible</em> via <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">RESTful APIs</a>,</li>
<li><em>Interoperable</em> as established semantic ontologies are used, and</li>
<li><em>Reusable</em> as all mappings are published within the Web app as MIT license</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the data transfer process is fully transparent.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-data-provenance-generation">Automatic Data Provenance Generation</h3>
<p>Provenance and other metadataare essential for determining ownership and trust.
However, defining such metadata typically stayed independent of the generation process.
In most cases, metadata is manually defined by the data publishers, rather than produced by the involved applications.
In PROV4ITDaTa, we rely on the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s that specify how the RDF knowledge graphs are generated
to automatically and incrementally generate complete provenance and metadata information of the data transfer process.
This way, it is assured that the metadata information is accurate, consistent and complete.
The resulting provenance information can be inspected by the user once the transfer process is completed.</p>
<p>The provenance information is described using the W3C recommended <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV-O</a> standard.
It covers the RDF knowledge graph generation, including metadata for the mapping rules definition and the data descriptions.
By automating the provenance and metadata generation relying on the machine interpretable descriptions in the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s,
metadata is generated in a systematic way and the generated provenance and metadata information becomes more accurate, consistent and complete.</p>
<p>Because of this provenance information the data transfer process is not only fully transparent before, but also after processing the data.</p>
<h3 id="output-rdf">Output RDF</h3>
<p>By relying on Semantic Web technologies, we achieve interoperability on multiple levels.</p>
<h4 id="syntactic-interoperability">Syntactic Interoperability</h4>
<p>Our solution provides multiple levels of Syntactic Interoperability by leveraging the standardized <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/">Turtle</a>-syntax for</p>
<ol>
<li>Defining the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s, which includes describing the Data Provider's Web APIs.</li>
<li>Representing the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> and <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a> generated by the <a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java">RML Mapper</a>.</li>
<li>Storing the resulting <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> on the Solid pods.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="semantic-interoperability">Semantic Interoperability</h4>
<p>Semantic Interoperability is achieved when multiple systems are able to develop the same understanding of the data.
To this end, the following choices where made</p>
<ul>
<li>The generated <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> data is accompanied by the corresponding provenance data.</li>
<li>The source data originating from the Data Providers is mapped in a generic manner using established ontologies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="structural-interoperability">Structural Interoperability</h4>
<p>Our solution solely produces <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> data, which by itself, offers the means to accomodate for Structural Interoperability.</p>
<h4 id="data-compatibility">Data Compatibility</h4>
<p>Storing the transformed data, provenance, and other metadata using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF</a> model enables us to correctly integrate the resulting data sets from different Data Providers.</p>
<h3 id="data-portability">Data Portability</h3>
<p>By transferring data from Data Providers to the user's <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a> pod we leverage Data Portability, which is one of <a href="https://inrupt.com/solid/">Solid</a>'s primary features.</p>
<h3 id="security-and-privacy">Security and Privacy</h3>
<p>As there are multiple parties involved in the data transfer (the user, Data Providers, Solid pods, and PROV4ITDaTa Web App)
not one person or entity can fully ensure the security and privacy of the entire system.
Instead, responsibility is shared among all the participants.
Here are some of the responsibilities and leading practices that contribute to the security and privacy of the system.
We will describe how these responsabilities are tackled, specifically in PROV4ITDaTa.</p>
<h4 id="data-minimization">Data Minimization</h4>
<p>When transferring data between providers, data minimization should be practiced.
Practically this means that all parties should only process and retain the minimum set of data that is needed to provide their service.
In the PROV4ITDaTa components, no data is stored, only processed.
The user can inspect exactly which data fields are processed by inspecting the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>,
and how these data fields are processed by inspecting the <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance data</a>.
All generated data is sent to the Solid pod, which is under full control of the user.</p>
<h4 id="user-control">User Control</h4>
<p>All PROV4ITDaTa transfer processes are initiated by the user, never automatically.
For each transfer process, the user needs to (re-)authenticate the PROV4ITDaTa process
— for both the Data Providers as the Solid pod —
using standardized authentication mechanisms such as <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> where possible.
Also, no authentication tokens are stored after the process completes.
This to guarantee no unwilling data transfer processes are initiated.</p>
<p>The user further has full control to which Solid pod its data is stored,
and by providing multiple alternative <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s,
it can personalize how the data is processed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently, a single Solid pod provider is supported (<a href="https://solidcommunity.net">https://solidcommunity.net</a>).
Our roadmap includes the possibility to choose your own Solid pod provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="minimal-scopes-for-auth-tokens">Minimal Scopes for Auth Tokens</h4>
<p>Where possible, only minimal (read-only) scopes are requested for Auth Tokens at the different Data Providers.
This further increases transparency into exactly what data will be moved,
and increases security so that if tokens are somehow leaked they have the minimal possible privilege.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, for the Flickr-service we only request the <code>read</code> scope, as this is possible in the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/">Flickr API</a>.
For the <a href="https://apidocs.imgur.com/">Imgur API</a>, however, there is no option to set a specific scope, so the default scope is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PROV4ITDaTa does not delete data from the Data Providers as part of the transfer.
This functionality is left to the Data Providers.</p>
<h4 id="data-retention">Data retention</h4>
<p>PROV4ITDaTa stores data only for the duration of the transfer process,
and all data transfer uses transport layer security over secure HTTPS connections.
The provenance information is available for the remainder of the user session,
and storage of that provenance information needs to be initiated by the user if needed.</p>
<p>All authentication tokens are stored solely on the client-side for the duration of the transfer process,
and are thus ephemeral: these tokens are automatically removed when the user's browser session ends.</p>
<h4 id="abuse">Abuse</h4>
<p>The Data Providers should have strong abuse protections built into their APIs.
Due to the fact that PROV4ITDaTa retains no user data beyond the life of a single transfer,
the Data Providers have the best tools to be able to detect and respond to abusive behavior,
e.g., using standard protocols such as <a href="https://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> to obtain API keys.</p>
<h3 id="personalization">Personalization</h3>
<p>In PROV4ITData, <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s are used to configure the data transfer process.
Multiple RML Mappings are available for the user, allowing for personalization:
the user can inspect the different RML Mappings, see which data fields are being processed,
and based on its context, choose which RML Mapping to execute.</p>
<h3 id="quality">Quality</h3>
<p>In PROV4ITDaTa, we ensure quality, both on data level as on software level.</p>
<h4 id="data-quality">Data Quality</h4>
<p>The <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s allow to transform data from heterogeneous data sources
into RDF Knowledge graphs.
The RML.io toolchain has been used in a <a href="https://rml.io/usage/">variety of existing projects and use cases</a>,
and allow to clean the original data by means of <a href="https://fno.io/rml/">FnO functions</a>.</p>
<p>The mappings are created manually by experts to ensure best practices,
and use established vocabularies.</p>
<h4 id="software-quality">Software Quality</h4>
<p>All processing tools have been <a href="https://rml.io/usage/">tested and applied</a> in production-like environments (TRL7),
and consist of unit and integration tests for</p>
<ul>
<li>RMLMapper-JAVA: <a href="https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/tree/master/src/test">https://github.com/RMLio/rmlmapper-java/tree/master/src/test</a></li>

</ul>
<p>At <a href="https://rml.io/implementation-report/">https://rml.io/implementation-report/</a>, you can compare our RMLMapper-JAVA processor with other RML processors.</p>
<h3 id="gdpr">GDPR</h3>
<p>As defined by Article 4 of the GDPR, PROV4ITData acts as a data processor for the end-user
(which become their own data controllers, conform the EU digital sovereignty vision),
as it allows individuals to easily transfer their files and data directly from Data Providers to their personal Solid pods.</p>
<p>This does not influence the GDPR roles of its complementary modules.
Each Data Provider will maintain full control over determining who has access to the data stored on their systems.
Access tokens need to be requested from each Data Provider the user would like to transfer data from, and from each Solid pod it would like to transfer data to.
PROV4ITDaTa will not mediate data access rights between Data Providers or Solid pods.
This ensures that API quotas continue to be managed by the Data Providers,
thereby helping to mitigate traffic spikes and negative impacts across Data Providers.</p>
<p>The security requirements are in line with Article 32 of the GDRP:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal data is transferred using transport layer security</li>
<li>no original personal data is destroyed</li>
<li>no original personal data is accessed or transmitted without authorization</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, consent of the user is given via the authorization flows in the different Data Providers and Solid pods.
We plan to include a clear privacy statement in the demonstrator.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Currently, PROV4ITData showcases how users can transparently transfer their data from different Data Providers
to their own Solid pod, using the RML.io toolchain.
We showcase transparency (by providing the <a href="#rml-mapping-documents">RML Mapping</a>s the and <a href="#automatic-data-provenance-generation">provenance</a> data),
and flexibility (by providing multiple Data Providers).</p>
<p>In our roadmap, we envision a general improvement of our demonstrator,
include a provenance-aware query-based importer using <a href="https://comunica.dev/">Comunica</a>,
and provide integration alternatives with, e.g., <a href="https://datatransferproject.dev/">DTP</a>.</p>
